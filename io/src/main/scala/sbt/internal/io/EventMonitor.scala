/**
 * Waits for build triggers. Builds can be triggered by source file updates as well as when the
 * watch is terminated by user input.
 *
 * An EventMonitor can be made using the apply method in the EventMonitor companion. Using this
 * handle, the user can block the current thread with awaitEvents until a build is triggered.
 * SBT has a few keys (watchingMessage, triggeredMessage) and internal tasks that require a
 * WatchState. The EventMonitor provides access to a WatchState via the state() method to ensure
 * that the apis that
 * use these keys continue working.
 *
 * No implementation details are specified so that the EventMonitor may be treated as a black box.
